## How to play the game
There are five bottles.
Each of them having a random amount of colors.
You may pour from one bottle to the other, but you may only pour (stack) to the same color of a different bottle.
The goal is to have 3 bottles filles with unique colors.
Have fun!

## Plans for future releases of the game
I plan to convert the java language to C#.
From the C# language I'll be able to port the game into unity for a GUI
